# FactionsX-BetterDynmap

**// PROJECT ABANDONED // ----------------------------------**

The FactionsX plugin has been abandoned. SavageLabs has randomly decided to throw in the towel, deleting their discord and taking down their build servers.
No point in further development for dead plugin.

If you are visting this repo trying to search for a solution to convert chunks to area markers in dynmap, good luck. 
I never figured it out, and I wish you the best of luck trying to.

The most you can come away from this repo with is a simple algorithm for placing f homes on the map, and some random config code, but thats about it.

If you have any questions about what anything in this code is doing or trying to do please create an issue and i'll explain it to you to the best of my ability.
Even though I could never figure this crap out i'd love to help somebody else do it.

Welcome to FXBD. This is an addon for SavageLabs' FactionsX that tries to better implement dynmap support.

GOALS:
- Properly outlined claims (no crappy per-chunk area markers https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/424743243767611392/855587714531590154/brave_161942_180621.png)
- Descriptive popup window that includes faction tag, description, members, bank, open status, etc.
- (PARTIALLY WORKING) Markers for homes and warps
- Leader can change color of your faction with proper permission node, could be a donator feature. (/f dynmapcolor #FFFFFF)
- Make asyncronous? Dont really know much about this but i'd figure that with as many loops this addon does it can't hurt to not do it on main thread.

THIS ADDON IS NONFUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT...
but it's coming soonâ„¢
