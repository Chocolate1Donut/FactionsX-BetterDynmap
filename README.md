# FactionsX-BetterDynmap
This is an addon for SavageLabs' FactionsX that tries to better implement dynmap support.

THIS ADDON IS NONFUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT

EngineBetterDynmap.java is me trying to make the SaberFactions dynmap implementation work with FactionsX

BetterDynmapEngine.java is me trying to rebuild it from the ground up.
