# FactionsX-BetterDynmap
Welcome to FXBD. This is an addon for SavageLabs' FactionsX that tries to better implement dynmap support. 
This is also my first Java project so give me a break please.

GOALS:
- Properly outlined claims (no crappy per-chunk area markers https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/424743243767611392/855587714531590154/brave_161942_180621.png)
- Descriptive popup window that includes faction tag, description, members, bank, open status, etc.
- (PARTIALLY WORKING) Markers for homes and warps
- Change color of your faction with proper permission node, could be a donator feature.

THIS ADDON IS NONFUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT...
but it's coming soonâ„¢
