# FactionsX-BetterDynmap
Welcome to FXBD. This is an addon for SavageLabs' FactionsX that tries to better implement dynmap support. 
This is also my first Java project so give me a break please.

GOALS:
- Properly outlined claims (no crappy per-chunk area markers https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/424743243767611392/855587714531590154/brave_161942_180621.png)
- Descriptive popup window that includes faction tag, description, members, bank, open status, etc.
- (PARTIALLY WORKING) Markers for homes and warps
- Leader can change color of your faction with proper permission node, could be a donator feature. (/f dynmapcolor #FFFFFF)
- Make asyncronous? Dont really know much about this but i'd figure that with as many loops this addon does it can't hurt to not do it on main thread.

THIS ADDON IS NONFUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT...
but it's coming soonâ„¢
